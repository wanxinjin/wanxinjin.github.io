##### **How to Apply (applying for one of two programs below)**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.6cm"> </p>

- **Apply for ME PhD Program:** Interested applicants can apply for ASU Mechanical Engineering PhD Program via [https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/mechanical-graduate/](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/mechanical-graduate/){:target="_blank"} and indicate Dr. [Wanxin Jin](https://wanxnijin.github.io){:target="_blank"} as your prospective supervisor in your statement of purpose and application form.



- **Apply for EE PhD Program** Interested applicants can also apply for ASU Electrical Engineering PhD Program via [https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESEEPHD/electrical-engineering-phd](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESEEPHD/electrical-engineering-phd){:target="_blank"} and indicate Dr. [Wanxin Jin](https://wanxnijin.github.io){:target="_blank"} as your prospective supervisor in your statement of purpose and application form.


- **Note that ASU ME PhD Program has the Deficiency Policy, which requires any non-ME undergraduate background student, admitted in ME PhD program, to take ME undergraduate courses (usually 3 courses) in addition to their graduate course requirement. Therefore, any student with non-ME undergraduate backgrounds is  encouarged to apply for EE PhD Program in order to join my group and avoid the Deficiency Policy.**
