#### **Two Ph.D. Positions Available!**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.6cm"> </p>

The Intelligent Robotics and Interactive Systems (IRIS) lab at Arizona State University (ASU) is seeking **two Ph.D. applicants** in the areas of robot learning and control for human-robot interaction and robot dexterous manipulation.


The IRIS lab focuses on developing interactive intelligence, enabling robots to (1) seamlessly interact with humans by understanding human intent, assisting with human decision-making, improving their intelligence through human intuitive interactions, and (2) skillfully manipulate physical objects by learning and planning with physical representations, touching and affecting objects with maximum dexterity, toward human-level physical intelligence. 


##### **Research Topics**
- Robot learning with human general interactions (e.g., physical interaction and/or language interaction)
- Planning and control for human-robot systems
- Computer vision and learnable geometry for dexterous manipulation
- Task and motion planning for sequential manipulation
- Fundamental research  in planning, control, and machine learning.
