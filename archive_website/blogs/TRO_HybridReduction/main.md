<p style="color:#828282;">
<b>Abstract</b>: Many critical tasks in robotics, like dexterous manipulation, are inherently contact-rich; the hybrid nature of making and breaking contact creates significant challenges for model representation and control. Specifically, for a task like in-hand manipulation, the combinatoric complexity in representing and choosing potential contact locations and sequences between robot and object, where there are thousands of potential hybrid modes, is not generally tractable. In this paper, we are inspired by the key observation that far fewer modes are actually necessary to accomplish many tasks. Building on our prior work in learning hybrid models, represented as linear complementarity systems, we find a reduced-order hybrid model requiring only a limited number of task-relevant modes. This simplified representation, in combination with a model predictive controller, enables real-time control and is sufficient for achieving high performance on tasks like multi-finger dexterous manipulation. We show that reduced-order model learning with on-policy data provably bounds closed-loop performance, leading to a simple iterative method to improve the reduced-order model and controller. We demonstrate the proposed method first on synthetic hybrid systems, reducing the mode count by multiple orders of magnitude while achieving task performance loss of less than 5%. Second, in simulation environment, we apply the proposed method to solve three-finger robotic hand manipulation for object reorientation. With no prior knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art closed-loop performance in less than five minutes of online learning.

##### **Learning Reduced-Order Linear Complementarity System (LCS)**

Linear Complementarity System (LCS), denoted as

<p style="margin-bottom:0.2cm; margin-left: 1.5cm"> </p>
is a compact representation of a piecewise affine system. Here,   zero or non-zero of each entry of $$ \boldsymbol{\lambda} $$ determine the linear affine dynamics in each mode. The maximum number of potential modes is $$\color{red}2^{\dim \boldsymbol{\lambda}}$$. 
For a reduced-order LCS, one can
explicitly restrict the number of potential modes in LCS by
setting $$\color{red}\dim \boldsymbol{\lambda}$$.

The learning of a LCS  i.e., identifying all  matrices $$(A,B,C,\boldsymbol{d},D,E,F,\boldsymbol{c})$$, is based on our prior work <d-cite key="jin2022learning"></d-cite>, which enables efficiently learning a piecewise affine model with up
to thousands of  modes and effectively handles the stiff
dynamics that arises from contact.

##### **Trust-Region LCS-based Model Predictive Controller**


We developed the LCS-based MPC controller, as part of our learning algorithm for on-policy data
collection and closed-loop control. The MPC controller is built on the direct method of trajectory optimization <d-cite key="posa2014direct"></d-cite>. This  MPC controller can run real-time with frequency up to 50Hz on robotic manipulation system.

## **Model Reduction on Synthetic Hybrid Control Systems**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm; margin-left: 1.5cm"> </p>


The task is to stabilize a piecewise affine (full-order) system, with a  quadratic cost function. The full-order dynamics, denoted as $$\boldsymbol{f}()$$, has more than 100 modes. The reduced-order LCS to be learned, denoted as  $$\color{red}\boldsymbol{g}()$$, has $$\color{red}\dim \boldsymbol{\lambda}=2$$ (i.e., max. 4 modes). Below is the phase plot of the full-order dynamics $$\boldsymbol{f}$$ with full-order MPC controller $$\boldsymbol{u}=\boldsymbol{f}$$-MPC$$(\boldsymbol{x})$$, versus with reduced-order MPC controller $$\boldsymbol{u}=\color{red}\boldsymbol{g}$$-MPC$$(\boldsymbol{x})$$. Different colors indicate different hybrid modes.

### **Manipulation Task 1: Cube Turning**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm; margin-left: 1.5cm"> </p>

The task is to let three robotic fingers turn the cube to any random orientation, sampled from $$\alpha^{\text{goal}}\sim U[âˆ’1.5, 1.5]$$  (rad). __No prior knowledge of the system dynamics model and no prior knowledge of the object is available__. The system is estimated to have thousands of potential modes. 




##### **Learning without prior knowledge in 5 mins**

### **Manipulation Task 2: Cube Moving**

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm; margin-left: 1.5cm"> </p>

 The task is to let three fingers move the cube to a random target pose $$(\boldsymbol{p}^{\text{goal}}, \alpha^{\text{goal}})$$, where the target position and angle are sampled from   $$\boldsymbol{p}^{\text{goal}}\sim U[âˆ’0.06, 0.06]$$  (m) and $$\alpha^{\text{goal}}\sim U[âˆ’1.5, 1.5]$$  (rad), respectively. __No prior knowledge of the system dynamics model and no prior knowledge of the object is available__. The system is estimated to have thousands of potential modes.

##### **Different contact strategies for different targets**

The following videos show different contact strategies generated by the same learned reduced-order LCS in its MPC rollout given different
targets.  Notably, as shown here, for different targets, the learned reduced-order LCS can produce different contact strategies between fingertips and the cube, such as separate, slip, and stick, and different decisions about which fingertip touches which face of the cube.
